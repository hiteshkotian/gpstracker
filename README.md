Distrubuted GPS tracking system

Masters Distributed systems project. 
This project creates a distributed global package delivery system. 
Every city has an office which is a peer and the head office is the server controlling all these branches.
Every City is connected to the three nearest cities to it. 

A client selects the destination and the source peer. The delivery system ensures quick delivery of the package.
